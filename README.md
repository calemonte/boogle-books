# Boogle Books

Boogle Books is a full-stack React-based application that allows users to search the Google Books API (by title) and save their favorites to the MongoDB database.

Deployed application: https://boogle-books.herokuapp.com/ 

## Develop

Clone the repository and then `npm install` the dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:calemonte/boogle-books.git
cd /boogle-books
npm install
```

To develop this project locally, you will need to have MongoDB installed and the server running in the background. To run the server in a dev environment, enter `npm start` from the root of your directory.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Axios
- Material UI
- Heroku (deployment)

## Notes

This project was my first using the Material UI library. While this is a relatively basic implementation of the UI core, it was a fine introduction to the many components Material makes available to the average developler. Future development might include more styling of the Material components and implementation of a Modal component for alerting users when something has been saved.
